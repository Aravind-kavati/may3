    "4)In DBSCAN, core points are data points with a minimum number of neighbors (min_samples) within the epsilon radius. They form the core of a cluster. Border points have fewer neighbors than the minimum requirement but are within the epsilon radius of a core point. They are considered part of the cluster but are less significant. Noise points (or outliers) are data points that have fewer neighbors than the minimum requirement and are not within the epsilon radius of a core point."

These outliers are detected based on the deviation from the local density or behavior of nearby instances. On the other hand, global outliers are anomalies that are distinct from the majority of the data across the entire dataset, irrespective of the local neighborhood. These outliers exhibit a deviation from the overall distribution or pattern of the data."
